1. Default Wrapper Classes and `Java.type`:

Mention that ChatTrigger provides default wrapper classes for Java objects, but you can also use `Java.type` to introduce Java Class classes that are not automatically converted. Provide examples of when to use each approach. 

Ex: You can use below code to get the class in minecraft
```javascript
const EntityArmorStand = Java.type("net.minecraft.entity.item.EntityArmorStand");
```

2. **`for...in` Loops and Variable Declaration**:

Highlight the usage of `for...in` loops in ChatTrigger JavaScript and clarify that when working with loops, it's necessary to use `let` to declare the loop variable (`key`) instead of `const`. 

3. JSDoc Annotations:
Annotate all functions with JSDoc comments.

Sure, here's the text formatted as a Markdown code block with the code snippet included:
