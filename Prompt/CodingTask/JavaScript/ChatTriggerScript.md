1. Default Wrapper Classes and `Java.type`:

Mention that ChatTrigger provides default wrapper classes for Java objects, but you can also use `Java.type` to introduce Java Class classes that are not automatically converted. Provide examples of when to use each approach.

For example, you can use the following code to get the class in Minecraft:

###javascript
const EntityArmorStand = Java.type("net.minecraft.entity.item.EntityArmorStand");
###

2. `for...in` Loops and Variable Declaration:

Highlight the usage of `for...in` loops in ChatTrigger JavaScript and clarify that when working with loops, it's necessary to use `let` to declare the loop variable (`key`) instead of `const`.

3. JSDoc Annotations:
Annotate all functions with JSDoc comments.
