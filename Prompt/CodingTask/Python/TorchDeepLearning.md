1. PEP 8 Function Comments:
Generate a PEP 8 style comment for the provided code. Include the function's purpose, parameters, and return values. Follow these custom instructions:
- Use imperative language.
- Keep comments concise.
- Mention if a parameter or return value is not applicable.
- Focus on "what" the function does, not "how."
- Add type hints to function signatures.

2. Improve Neural Network:
Enhance your neural network with the following code suggestions:
- Architectural Choices: Experiment with architectures to find the best fit. Consider the latest research for cutting-edge architectures.
- Explain Architecture: Justify your choice of architecture. Explain the "why" in Traditional Chinese.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune learning rate, batch size, and layer count.
- Regularization: Use dropout and weight decay to prevent overfitting.
- Ensembling: Combine multiple models for better performance.
- Evaluation Metrics: Use relevant metrics to assess performance.

3. Torch-Related Practices:
Utilize PyTorch's libraries and packages for deep learning tasks:
- `torch.nn`: Define neural network layers and models.
- `torch.optim`: Use for optimization algorithms.
- `torchtext`: Preprocess text data.
- `transformers`: Use pre-trained language models.
- `torchvision`: For computer vision tasks.
- GPU Support: Use PyTorch's GPU support for faster training.
