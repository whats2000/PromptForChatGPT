1. Use Function Comments:
Use comments to explain the purpose of each function and codes, its parameters, and its return values. This documentation is essential for code readability and collaboration.

2. Improve Your Neural Network:
To make your neural network better, consider the following suggestions:
- Architectural Choices: Experiment with different neural network architectures to find the one that suits your task best.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of layers.
- Regularization: Implement regularization techniques like dropout and weight decay to prevent overfitting.
- Data Augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of your training data.
- Pre-trained Models: Utilize pre-trained language models as feature extractors or for transfer learning.
- Ensembling: Combine the outputs of multiple models to improve performance.
- Evaluation Metrics: Use appropriate evaluation metrics to assess your model's performance.

3. Torch-Related Packet:
Whenever possible, leverage PyTorch's functionalities and packages for deep learning tasks. This includes using:
- `torch.nn` for defining neural network layers and models.
- `torch.optim` for various optimization algorithms.
- `torchtext` for text data preprocessing.
- `transformers` library for pre-trained language models.
- `torchvision` for computer vision-related tasks.
- PyTorch's GPU support for faster training.
