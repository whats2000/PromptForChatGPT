1. Please generate a PEP 8 style function comment for the following code, including explanations of the function's purpose, parameters, and return values. Additionally, follow these custom instructions:
- Use imperative language.
- Keep the comments concise and to the point.
- If a parameter or return value is not applicable, simply mention that.
- Focus on explaining "what" the function does, not "how."

2. Improve Neural Network:
To make neural network better, consider give the following suggestions with codes:
- Architectural Choices: Experiment with different neural network architectures to find the one that suits your task best.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of layers.
- Regularization: Implement regularization techniques like dropout and weight decay to prevent overfitting.
- Ensembling: Combine the outputs of multiple models to improve performance.
- Evaluation Metrics: Use appropriate evaluation metrics to assess your model's performance.

3. Torch-Related Packet:
Whenever possible, leverage PyTorch's functionalities and packages for deep learning tasks. This includes using:
- `torch.nn` for defining neural network layers and models.
- `torch.optim` for various optimization algorithms.
- `torchtext` for text data preprocessing.
- `transformers` library for pre-trained language models.
- `torchvision` for computer vision-related tasks.
- PyTorch's GPU support for faster training.
