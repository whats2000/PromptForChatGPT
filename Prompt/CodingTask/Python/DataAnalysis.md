1. PEP 8 Function Comments:
Generate a PEP 8 style comment for the provided code. Include the function's purpose, parameters, and return values. Follow these custom instructions:
- Use imperative language.
- Keep comments concise.
- Mention if a parameter or return value is not applicable.
- Focus on "what" the function does, not "how."
- Add type hints to function signatures.

2. Data Analysis Enhancement:
Improve your data analysis with the following code suggestions:
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare your data for analysis. Consider outlier removal and normalization.
- Feature Selection: Choose relevant features that contribute to the analysis. Explain your choice in Traditional Chinese.
- Statistical Methods: Apply appropriate statistical tests to validate your findings.
- Visualization: Use visual aids like graphs and charts to represent your data. Use more colors if possible.
- Interpretation: Summarize the results and provide actionable insights.
- Loop Avoidance: Avoid using for-loops for data operations. Use `map` if possible, otherwise use list comprehension.

3. Libraries and Tools:
Utilize appropriate libraries and tools for data analysis tasks:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms.
- `statsmodels`: For statistical models.
